# Update Roadmap

Updated: 2026-07-14 Europe/Berlin

## Immediate

1. Booking end-to-end verification
- Apps Script production deploy is pending version cleanup because the project reached the 200-version limit
- run Admin booking E2E diagnostics before a real customer-flow test
- Netlify booking submit
- Google Sheets row creation
- Google Calendar event creation
- Apple Calendar reflection check
- customer mail delivery
- admin notification mail
- admin edit / reschedule / cancel

2. Lexware actual workflow validation
- run `점검/전송` preflight on one real invoice
- send one real invoice only after the preflight confirms customer / amount / address / contact state
- sync payment status via `💶 상태`
- verify booking ledger / invoice sheet / accounting tab update consistently
- confirm receivables are driven by Lexware status when available

3. Receivables cleanup
- verify which rows should truly remain `미수금`
- remove false positives from local-only completed payments
- confirm contract deposit / balance payments show consistently

## Next

6. Gutschein V2 customer redemption design
- add `예약중` hold state
- customer-side code validation in booking final step
- hold release on timeout / cancel / failed submit
- finalize voucher on successful booking submit only
- add admin hold monitor and release tools

7. Calendar performance follow-up
- measure current month / next month / third month load gap
- tune month-summary cache TTL
- refine background prefetch order
- reduce visual confusion while loading later months

8. Select real-session verification
- open existing session link
- restore existing submission
- submit update flow
- extra prints / extra retouch totals
- success screen / invoice number / drive link confirmation

9. Mail content cleanup
- reduce repeated text across pending / confirmed / follow-up mails
- unify Korean / English / German tone
- verify pre-wedding / passport infant / dol guide content balance

## Later

10. Corporate / Event product redesign
- split photo vs video more clearly
- separate wedding / registry wedding / dol / corporate use cases if needed
- improve consultation payload structure without exposing pricing

11. Final design pass
- booking success screen polish
- select design alignment with booking
- spacing / typography consistency review
- mobile safe-area and in-app browser polish

12. Ops checklist refresh
- deployment notes
- known caveats
- regression checklist
- admin dirty-file warning

13. Optional finance expansion
- decide whether instant card sales also create Lexware documents
- if needed, add SumUp or bank CSV import path
- otherwise keep those flows as local-ledger + summary export only
